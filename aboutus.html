    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>In March of 2020, the coronoavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19, became widespread across the globe, upending the life of every person on it. It is estimated that approximately 3.2 million worldwide, and 577,000+ people in the United States alone, have died as a result of COVID-19. These statistics are not just numbers, they represent lives forever lost, causing a wave of grief, and creating a ripple effect felt throughout the world. In order to adequately put this into perspective, EVERY aspect of human life has been significantly touched by COVID-19. Millions of workers are now faced with unemployment, or the elimination of their jobs altogether. Weddings, funerals, graduations, sporting events, concerts, and vacations have been cancelled or postponed. Going out to dinner with family and friends hasn't even been an option until recently. Most movie theaters have been closed, and remain that way for the time being. Parents have been challenged to balance personal and professional priorities, while trying to ensure their child receives a quality education online. Both, have been working remotely. No matter where you reside on the globe, you've been affected in a multitude of ways you never thought possible. Although there is light at the end of the tunnel, with regards to vaccination distribution, we are still fighting an invisible enemy. Slowly, but surely, we will open buildings and businesses, and strive for some sense of normalcy. But will things ever truly be the same? Socialization with others, as we once knew it, in any capacity, has forever changed. It is the importance of this last statement, that M.A.S.C. has transformed from imagination into becoming a reality.

    <h1>The M.A.S.C Mission</h1>
    <p>"To provide mass, accessibility, safety, and cost-effective means to obtain an air-purifying face mask."</p>

    <div>
    <h1>What We Do & Why We Do It</h1>
    <p>We do exactly what our mission statement says we do. We provide safe, cost-effective, air-purifying face masks that are easily accessible to the public. We acknowledge how difficult the last year has been, and recognize that there are opposing views about social distancing, face coverings, and receiving the vaccine. Rather than arguing any of these points, we believe we've come up with a viable solution for ALL people that addresses these issues. With our product, family, friends, co-workers, etc. can once again reunite safely, regardless of their current status in relation to the virus. For those of us that have not chosen the vaccine, and don't particularly want to wear a cloth face mask, this is a great alternative. You can still be in close proximity to the ones you love.. Those who have been vaccinated can wear the mask as a layer of precaution.</p>
