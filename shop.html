    <p>This mask is the best! The fan and air purifier not only keep me cool, but reassure me that I'm breathing fresh, clean air.
        The fact that I have three different options to recharge it with minimal time and effort, make my lfe much less complicated. It has literally been a lifesaver.

    <p>So Comfortable. I hardly feel like I'm wearing it, and I love that I don't have to worry about losing it thanks to the neck lanyard. Because it comes in an array of colors and patterns, I was able to purchase a few to help me accessorize my wardrobe.</p>

    <p>I can't believe I can eat with this mask! It's incredible! I no longer have to worry about going out to dinner with friends, because
    I don't have to take it off to enjoy my meal.

    <p>The plastic shields provide an extra layer of protection that makes me comfortable being around other people. It's easy to clean with sanitized handwipes, and it doesn't leave streaks. I would have given this product a higher rating, but my package didn't include the color and pattern of the mask I ordered.</p>

    <p>The body suit feels weightless. I'm still mobile and able to move around effortlessly. It may not be the most stylish article of clothing I own, but during these times my focus has shifted from fashionable to practical.</p>

    <p>As far as gloves go, they are snug, but functional, and stretch out with consistent use. They are designed to fit a wide range of differently sized people.</p>
