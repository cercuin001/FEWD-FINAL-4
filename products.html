<h3>covercorps© M.A.S.C</h3>

<p> M.A.S.C is a top-of-the-line wearable Air purifing Mask that can be used for daily use. It’s electric filtering technology provides hours of air filtration with the same technology used in high-end air purifiers. M.A.S.C consist of dual fans and a respiratory sensor that detects the volume of the wearers breathe to speed up its fans speed with air intake and will slow down its fans when air is being exhaled to decrease resistance. It has H13 level HEPA filters and has rechargeable batteries that offers up to 10 hours of clean filtered air per use but what also makes M.A.S.C so outstanding and different from the rest, it has solar power technology which enables it to charge itself. WOW! This mask also offers a UV light that self sanitizes and kills germs on contact. This versatile mask sends a notification to an app that can be downloaded on IOS or android indicating when filters need to be replaced or when it may need any type of services.
